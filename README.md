# CSFlow

This is a continuation of the View Controller module found here:
https://github.com/awt2542/ViewController-for-Framer

In addition to the above, CSFlow now includes 'Modals'


### New functions

* showModalBottom
* showModalLeft
* showModalRight
* showModalTop
* showModalCenter


This allows for the addition of overlay artboards such as:
* Menus
* Notifications
* Native modals


### The sketch plugin also has the new options included.

You can also have a layer be a back button _AND_ a link to a new artboard (this is perfect for menu clicks)

Just set the layer name to something like:
`backButton_pushInRight_artboardTwo`
